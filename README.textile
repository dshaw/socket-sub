h1. PubSubHubbub Web Socket Subscriber

Big thanks to "dshaw":http://github.com/dshaw/socket-sub for helping me boostrap this.

There is a temporary demo of this server that is running at @http://node.superfeedr.com/@. And a demo client "gracefully hosted by Github as a page":http://julien51.github.com/socket-sub/ :)

h2. Install and dependencies

This needs to happen on a server that is NOT behind a firewall. PubSubHubbub is a server-to-server protocol. It won't work on your local machine. You can certainly try to use the wonderful "Localtunnel":http://github.com/progrium/localtunnel/ from "@progrium":http://twitter.com/progrium, the wizard.

# Install "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/

# Install "ExpressJS":http://expressjs.com/guide.html

# Clone repository : @git clone git://github.com/julien51/socket-sub.git@

# Add the node-websocket-server submodule : @git submodule init@ and @git submodule update@

h2. Configure

# @cp default_config.json config.json@

# Edit the @config.json@ file (Feel free to setup the @debug@ flag to true if something is weird)

h2. Run it

# @$ node server.js@

# Edit the @client.html@ file 

# Open in it your favorite browser (even from your local filesystem, the magic happens thru websockets). Ha, yes you *need a browser that supports WebSockets*.



Have fun!
